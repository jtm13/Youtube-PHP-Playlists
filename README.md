# Youtube-PHP-Playlists
Gets data from the playlists of the test user (me). It is more of a practice of the YouTube Data API than anything else. It gets the total amount of playlists created (besides Watch Later and Liked (does not allow)) and goes through each of the playlists to see their details.
